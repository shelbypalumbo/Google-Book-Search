**Work in progress as of 5/29/20: User authentication and incorporating Redux.**

## User Story

As an avid reader I want to be able to search and save books that I am interested in, so that I can easily find a place to purchase the book when I finish the ones that I have read.

## Usage

The Track-a-Book application implements a search form that queries the google books API with the search input value and retrieves relevant books title, author, image, novel summary, and a link to purchase.
Users can add any book to their saved books which are stored in the 'Books' collection of a mongoDB database. If the user no longer wishes to have a book saved to their page, they can delete the it with the click of a button.
